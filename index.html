									<h2>Answering Door Bell</h2>
									<p>One of my best projects, the Answering Door Bell was initiated by the chairperson of our school. Though first prototype was made by our ATL incharge, Mr. Hirak Biswas, I am taking the project further. This simple device displays a message to the guest on your behalf if you are busy at that moment.
									This project was showcased at the Make Tomorrow For Innovation Generation (MTFIG) National Showcase, New Delhi (2018)  </p>

									<h2>Water Overflow Detector / Smart Water Tank</h2>
									<p>This was my one of very first project made with an arduino and solves a very common problem of our society- shortage of water. The device can be installed on any overhead tank and then you don't have to manually operate the water pump. The device will do it for you, withou even a drop of water being wasted.</p>
